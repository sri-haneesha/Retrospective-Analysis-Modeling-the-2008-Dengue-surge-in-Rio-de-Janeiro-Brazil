# Retrospective-Analysis-Modeling-the-2008-Dengue-surge-in-Rio-de-Janeiro-Brazil
This project models the 2008 dengue fever outbreak in Rio de Janeiro using Python, integrating real-world climate data with differential equation-based transmission models. The analysis simulates temperature-dependent dengue spread and evaluates the potential effectiveness of public health interventions.

**Objectives**
Develop a dengue transmission model based on historical climate and epidemiological data.
Predict dengue spread dynamics using temperature-dependent factors.
Visualize and summarize outbreak patterns to inform intervention strategies.

**Dataset**
Climate Data: Historical temperature, rainfall, and humidity for Rio de Janeiro (2008).
Epidemiological Data: Reported dengue cases in Rio de Janeiro for 2008.
Source: Publicly available climate and health datasets.

**Methodology**
Built a differential equation model for dengue transmission.
Integrated climate variables (temperature, rainfall) to simulate vector dynamics.
Conducted simulations to predict the outbreak trajectory and evaluate potential interventions.
Visualized results using matplotlib and summarized insights in Excel.

**Key Findings**
Temperature significantly influences the rate of dengue transmission.
Model simulations aligned closely with the observed 2008 outbreak trends.
Visualization of intervention scenarios helped assess the potential impact of vector control strategies.

**Tools & Libraries**
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
Excel for summary tables and additional visualizations

**Future Scope**
Extend the model to predict future outbreaks under climate change scenarios.
Integrate mobility and demographic data to enhance model accuracy.
Apply the model for other vector-borne diseases in similar climates.
